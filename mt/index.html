          <h1>About</h1>

          I'm a UKCP accredited psychotherapist, as well as an accredited Cognitive-Behavioural Psychotherapist. I'm passionate about my work, and I'm a keen advocate of parity of esteem between mental and physical health. I have a special interest in medically unexplained conditions such as IBS, ME, and fibromyalgia, and have undertaken research in this area and have presented at conferences on this topic.
          <br> <br>
          I began working clinically in 2011, and I have a wide range of clinical experience, having worked in the NHS, mental health charities, drug and alcohol services, and in private practice.
          <br> <br>
          In the course of my clinical work I have helped people with anxiety, depression, addiction issues, bereavement issues, trauma, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, low self-esteem, relationship issues, psychosexual issues, dissociation, and psychosis & schizophrenia.
          <br> <br>
          I am committed to my professional growth in the field of psychotherapy, both for my personal satisfaction and with the aim of being better able to help my clients.
